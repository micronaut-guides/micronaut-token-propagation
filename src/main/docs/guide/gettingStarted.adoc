Lets describe the microservices you are going to build through the tutorial.

* `gateway` - A secured via JWT microservice which exposes an endpoint `/user`. The output of that endpoint is the result of consuming the `userecho` endpoint.
* `userecho` - A secured via JWT microservice which exposes an endpoint `/user` which responds the username of the authenticated user.

The next diagram illustrates the flow:

We generate valid JWT in the gateway microservice. Then every microservice in our app is able to validate those JWT. We want every internal request to contain a valid JWT token. If we want to talk to another microservice we need to propagate the valid JWT get received.
